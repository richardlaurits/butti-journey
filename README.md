## 🔑 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Email-based interfaces** - Interactive buttons in emails for job applications

### What Didn't Work
1. **Over-automation** - Too many cron jobs created notification fatigue
2. **Complex scrapers** - Career site scrapers often broke due to JS requirements
3. **Daily fantasy updates** - Too frequent, reduced to weekly

### Technical Insights
