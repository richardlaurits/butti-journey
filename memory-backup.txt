OPENCLAW & TECHNOLOGY SETUP
================================================================================

Projects & Blockers:
1. Browser Automation for FF tracking
   - Issue: Wayland + ARM64 on Ubuntu makes xdotool control difficult
   - Solution discussed: Install OpenClaw on Mac for proper Chrome extension pairing
   - Status: Blocked (Richard cautious about Mac terminal installation/trust)

2. Morning Brief (ACTIVE ✅)
   - Cron job running 07:00 CET daily
   - Format: 5 sections (FPL, AI News, Trump/Politics, Crypto, Local)

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

Fantasy Football Strategy:
1. You're in TOP 1% across all three leagues (exceptional)
2. Form matters: Your recent GW25 (66p, 2nd best) shows strength
3. Differentials win: Low-owned players (José Sá 1.1%, Mateus Mané 2.3%) can close gaps
4. Max 3 per team rule forces diversity — use it tactically
5. Monitor competitor mistakes (Tractor Boys benched Haaland — vulnerable!)
6. Fixtures matter: Easy matches (Bremen vs Bayern, Pauli vs Leverkusen) = priority targets

Data Verification:
- Don't dismiss players without checking stats (e.g., Undav has 11 goals — strong!)
- Cross-reference multiple sources before making transfers
- Bundesliga.com official stats > older memory data
- Real-time tracking beats assumptions

Communication:
- Be honest about uncertainty instead of guessing
- You prefer action-oriented, concise advice
- You value competence + accuracy over false confidence
