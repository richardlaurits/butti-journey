## Key Insights

### ✅ High-Leverage Agents
These deliver maximum strategic value per resource unit:
- watchdog-agent: leverage score 53.8  
- bundesliga-agent: leverage score 52.5  
- ops-intelligence: leverage score 48.4  

### ⚠️ Under-Leveraged
Agents with potential but not currently aligned to top priorities:
- french-tutor-agent: 80/100 capability, 0.0/100 alignment  
- investment-agent: 75/100 capability, 0.0/100 alignment  

## Misalignment Warnings

- Health is a top priority but requires manual activation - consider enabling auto-heal  

## Recommended Leverage Move

**Action:** Activate Health Agent Auto-Mode

**Rationale:**
- Health optimization is a top-3 priority (70/100)
- Health-agent has high contribution strength (85/100)
- Currently requires manual activation (wasted potential)

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Edit agents/ops-intelligence/agent_schedules.json
# Set health-agent.auto_activate = true
# Set active_days = ["monday", "wednesday", "friday", "sunday"]
```

**Expected ROI:**
- Time saved: ~5 min/week manual checks
- Risk reduction: Continuous health monitoring
- Alignment improvement: +15 points

## Next Review

**Schedule:** Weekly (next: 2026-03-07)
**Trigger:** Major priority shift or agent performance degradation
**Auto-adjust:** Enabled for Tier-1 reallocations
