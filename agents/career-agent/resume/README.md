# Resume Management

## Files

- `current-resume.pdf` — Latest version (uploaded by Richard)
- `current-resume-parsed.md` — Machine-readable version
- `current-resume-optimized.md` — Keyword-optimized for ATS
- `archive/` — Previous versions

## Workflow

1. Richard uploads PDF → I parse & save parsed version
2. For each job, I generate role-specific optimized resume
3. Archive old versions for reference
4. Track which version was used for each application

## Optimization Rules

- Keywords from job posting injected
- Most relevant experience highlighted
- ATS-friendly formatting (bullets, no fancy formatting)
- Tailored for role & company type

Placeholder until Richard provides current resume.
