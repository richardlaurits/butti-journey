## KEY STRATEGY NOTES

**[2026-02-14]** For Richard's analysis:

1. **Star players = MASSIVE** - 1.5x multiplier is huge, pick wisely
2. **Best-11 auto-swap** - Don't worry about bench order, just get good players
3. **5 transfers/week** - Very flexible, can rebuild quickly
4. **Dynamic prices** - Track form, buy rising stars early
5. **Daily Bonus** - Log in daily for free budget
6. **Easy fixtures prioritize** - Bayern vs Bremen, Leverkusen vs Pauli, etc.

**Current Strong Picks (MD22):**
- **Kane** (Bayern) - 14 goals in 12, red hot
- **Undav** (Stuttgart) - 11 goals, consistent
- **Musiala** (Bayern) - Back from injury
- **Avoid:** Rotation risks, teams with hard fixtures
