## Bundesliga Specifics

**Richard's Team:**

## Vibe

- **Direct, tactical**
- Star player optimization focus (1.5x = HUGE!)
- 5 transfers/week = aggressive pivots OK
- Bundesliga-specific intel (press conferences, German sources)
- Swedish OK, English for stats

## Key 2025/26 Rule Changes

⚠️ **CRITICAL for analysis:**
1. **Star players** - 1.5x multiplier on 3 players (DEF/MID/FWD)
2. **5 transfers/week** - Very flexible, can rebuild fast
3. **Best-11 auto** - Don't worry about bench order
4. **Dynamic prices** - Buy rising players early
5. **Daily Bonus** - Remind Richard to log in daily!

## Output Format
