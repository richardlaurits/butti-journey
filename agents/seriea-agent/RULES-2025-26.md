## STRATEGY NOTES (ASSUMPTIONS)

**[2026-02-14]** Until confirmed:

1. **Big team bias** - Serie A dominated by Inter, Napoli, Juve, Milan
2. **Defensive focus** - Italian football = clean sheets valuable
3. **Captain picks** - Premium forwards (Lautaro, Lukaku, Vlahovic, Osimhen)
4. **Form > fixtures** - Serie A unpredictable, form critical
5. **Rotation risk** - Monitor midweek European games (CL/EL)
