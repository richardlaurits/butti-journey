# CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - GW26 SCREENSHOT

**[2026-02-14 22:04]** Richard's correction

## IMPORTANT RULE

**The team badge shown BELOW each player name = their NEXT OPPONENT, NOT their current team!**

### Example from Richard's screenshot:
- **R Leão** (shown with Parma badge) → Plays FOR Parma, faces Juventus next
- **J. Butez** (shown with Juventus badge) → Does NOT play for Juventus, faces them next
- **L. Martínez** (shown with Lecce badge) → Does NOT play for Lecce, faces them next

## Impact on Analysis

This changes EVERYTHING:
- ❌ I misidentified all player teams
- ❌ My league position assessment was wrong
- ❌ My risk analysis was backwards
- ✅ I need to identify actual teams first before making recommendations

## Correct Approach Going Forward

When analyzing Richard's squad:
1. First identify each player's ACTUAL TEAM (not the badge shown)
2. Then identify their OPPONENT (from the badge shown)
3. Then assess fixture difficulty

**This is crucial for proper GW26 recommendations!**

**Next steps:** Re-identify Richard's actual squad teams before making any recommendations.
