- GK Bench: Element 670

## GW26 Post-Mortem ⚰️

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Bench Waste:** 15 pts on bench = potentially crucial decisions
2. **TC on Saliba:** Good play in principle (ARS DGW) but only 6 pts TC yield
3. **Haaland Not Captained:** Seems overburdened with defensive focus?
4. **Event Rank Collapse:** 6M+ rank = massively underperformed expected score (~60+ pts)

**Why 45pts is BAD:**
- Average GW26 ~54 pts (per bootstrap)
- Richard ~20% below expected

**Likely Issues:**
- Arsenal DGW didn't deliver as promised
- Bench decisions (rotations/injuries hit)
- No differential plays visible in squad composition

---

## GW27 STRATEGY

**1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (by Saturday 18:45 deadline):**
- ❌ SELL/BENCH: Saliba (OUT GW27 due to illness)
- ✅ CONSIDER: Haaland captain (bounce-back, underperformed GW26)
- ✅ CONSIDER: Salah captain (steady, vs Brighton)
- ⚠️ TRANSFER: Free hit if squad too imbalanced post-Saliba

**2. DIFFERENTIAL WATCH (<10% owned):**
- Gabriel (Arsenal, underrated after DGW)
- Newcastle defense (difficulty 2)
- Brighton attacking assets (vs weak ARS defense)

**3. NEXT 5 GW FIXTURE PLANNING:**
- Arsenal: BRE, WOL (GW27-28) = better after GW27 break
- Man City: NEW, BRE, EVE (GW27-29) = decent run
- Liverpool: BRI, CHE, CRY (GW27-29) = good opportunities

## Notes & Lessons

**2025/26 Key Rules:**
- **Double Chips Active** - Remaining chips for season: 1xWC (H2), 1xFH (H2), 1xBB (H2), 1x3xC (H2)
- **Defensive Points Matter:** Asset selection crucial for high-CBIT players
- **DGW Overweighting Risk:** GW26 showed that doubling up on DGW teams = variance, not guaranteed success
- **Haaland Rotation Myth:** Check ownership %  - if >80%, maybe consider alternatives for captaincy

**Price Watch:** 
- Updates nightly at 20:00 CET
- Watch Saliba for drops (illness = price risk)
- Rising players: Monitor for GW27 movers

**League Standing:** 
- Mini-league position unclear (league ID not found in API)
- Use "Sv FPL-Podden MEDLEM" or "Sandhemsvägens drömliga" as proxy
- Target: Top 3 within season

**Last squad update:** 2026-02-14 12:08 (MANUAL - need API integration)
