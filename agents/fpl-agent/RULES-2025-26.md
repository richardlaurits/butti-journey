## KEY STRATEGY NOTES

**[2026-02-14]** For Richard's analysis:

1. **Defensive assets MORE valuable** - CBs with high CBIT (Tarkowski-style)
2. **Chip timing critical** - 2x of each chip = more aggressive plays possible
3. **DGW planning** - Arsenal/Wolves had DGW in GW26 (check future DGWs)
4. **Ownership matters** - Template vs differential decisions
5. **Fixtures** - Always check next 5 GW fixture difficulty
