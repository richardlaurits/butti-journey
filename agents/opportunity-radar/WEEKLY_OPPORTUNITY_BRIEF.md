## Top 3 Actionable Opportunities

### 1. Resolve Mass Agent Dormancy (8/9 inactive)
**Theme:** System Optimization  
**Leverage Score:** 90/100  
**Effort:** Medium - verify scheduler integration with heartbeat  
**Risk:** Medium - requires testing activation flow

**Current State:**  
Smart scheduler deployed, 0 activations logged

**Evidence:**
- Only 1/9 agents active  
- Agent stability: 11.1/100 (critical)  
- Smart scheduler deployed but no activations yet  
- High-leverage agents (watchdog, ops-intel) running but others dormant  

**Expected ROI:**  
60% more agents self-managing = 3-4 hours/week saved

**Recommended Action:**  
```bash
Add smart_scheduler.py to HEARTBEAT.md rotation
```

### 2. Enable Health Agent Auto-Mode
**Theme:** Health Optimization  
**Leverage Score:** 85/100  
**Effort:** Low - single config change  
**Risk:** Low - reversible, health data is local

**Current State:**  
Manual activation only

**Evidence:**
- Health is top-3 priority (70/100)  
- Health-agent has 85/100 capability  
- Currently requires manual activation (wasted potential)  
- No recoveries needed (stable subsystem)  

**Expected ROI:**  
Continuous health monitoring + 5min/week saved

**Recommended Action:**  
```bash
Set health-agent.auto_activate = true in agent_schedules.json
```

### 3. Activate French Tutor for Daily Lessons
**Theme:** Language Learning  
**Leverage Score:** 75/100  
**Effort:** Low - enable auto_activate + review schedule  
**Risk:** Low - educational content only

**Current State:**  
Auto-activation disabled

**Evidence:**
- Language learning is priority (70/100)  
- French-tutor-agent capability: 80/100  
- Agent is under-leveraged (listed in insights)  
- Low resource cost (simple lessons)  

**Expected ROI:**  
Daily French practice without manual triggering

**Recommended Action:**  
```bash
Enable auto_activate, align hours with learning preference (morning/evening)
```

## Strategic Context

**Priority Alignment Check:**
- ✅ Fantasy & Career: Well-resourced (expanded hours)
- ⚠️ Health: High priority, low automation (manual-only)
- ⚠️ Language: High priority, disabled agent
- ⚠️ Family: Only recovery was here (fragile)

**Key Insight:**  
System has **high capability** (9 specialized agents) but **low activation** (11% running). 
The infrastructure exists—opportunity is in unlocking it.
